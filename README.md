# Summer-Project

## Web Application 
Goal is to create a landing-page(want to make it close to Zerodha homepage) first with sign-up feature
Post-signup we enter a kite kinda dashboard where we can add watchlist of stocks, buy and sell holdings, track the orders show a pie-chart kinda structure.
 Also need to find a good API for live stock market data in India(Only paid API are there but lets go with it).


### Using Vite+React Application for frontend here!!
